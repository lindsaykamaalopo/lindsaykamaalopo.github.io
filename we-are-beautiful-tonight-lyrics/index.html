<p>Ive been waiting To taste your kiss Touch you in the dark Hold you to my heart Ive been hoping For that moment Wed be making love Now the time has. Freedom and fireflies in the air. EnjoyI do not own the music or the Picture. Oh woah Dont wake me up Im so alive Wish you could see what I see Through these eyes of mine Now were standing face to face I can hear the words were saying. I was thinking I had your picture on my phone Got me dreamin bout somewhere we dont know You stole my favorite shirt And left my clothes in your shower stall.
