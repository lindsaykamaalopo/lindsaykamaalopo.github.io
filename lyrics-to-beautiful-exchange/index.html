<p>My only desire and sole ambition Is to love You just the same. Chorus 2 When only love Could make a way You gave Your life In a beautiful exchange. Verse 3 My burden erased My life forgiven There is nothing That can take this love away My only desire And sole ambition Is to love You just the same. In a beautiful exchange My burden erase my life forgiven There is nothing that could take this love away. Then I let You in.
