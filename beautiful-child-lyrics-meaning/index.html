<p>Beautiful child Beautiful child You are a beautiful child And I am a fool once more You fell in love when I was only ten The years disappeared Much has gone by since then I bite my lip can you send me away You touch I have no choice I have to stay Ooh I had to stay Ooh I had to stay Sleepless child There is so little time Your eyes say yes But you dont say yes I wish that you were mine I wish that you were mine. No no no no no no no no No no no no no no no no Chorus. No one else sees but I got stuck and soon forever came. And I am a fool once more. When I am older than these small god damned hills And theres no reason for my mind to be still Oh how Ill feel like a beautiful child Such a beautiful child again When I have finally found my room filled with toys Be banging on my crib excited by noise Oh how Ill feel like a beautiful child Such a beautiful child again And when theres nothing to gain Or bring me pain or pin the blame On you or myself And when they finally fall These wailing walls and burdened crosses Gods twilights. Country Music Happy Anniversary Roy Rogers Lyrics And Chords Lyrics And Chords Music Happy Happy Song Lyrics.</p>

<p>Forever 17 Again Peace Is Just a Word My True Love Power to the Meek Lifted Anything But Strong Beautiful Child I Want It All Ive Tried Everything I Saved the World Today. There is no other. Hold you again I fell into love You learnt how to fight Well I wish that you were mine Something that I said Made you wear a frown The way you hang your head Has made the tears come down But dont you wear a sigh My beautiful child You know it doesnt burn When you touch the sun So dont be concerned My golden one Youre gonna reach the sky. Stopped pushing on for just a second then nothings changed. And many others Eurythmics lyrics for you.
