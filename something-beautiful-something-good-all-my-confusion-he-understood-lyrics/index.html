<p>But he made something beautiful of my life. Something beautiful something good All my confusion He. Something beautiful something good. Something beautiful something good All my confusion He understood All I had to offer Him was brokenness and strife But he made something beautiful of my life If there ever were dreams That were lofty and noble They were my dreams at the start And hope for lifes best were the hopes That I harbor down deep in my heart But my dreams turned to ashes And my castles all crumbled my fortune. Hell make something beautiful of your life. Butterfly And Hymn Pic Plant Leaves This Is Us Photo.</p>
