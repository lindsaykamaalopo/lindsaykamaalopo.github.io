No shes not that kind She dont know shes beautiful. Theres a feeling burning in my heart She turns a key thats always open One look from her and thats all I need to start And none has seen the word is spoken. Never crossed her mind She dont know shes beautiful. Provided to YouTube by Universal Music GroupShe Dont Know Shes Beautiful Sammy KershawHaunted Heart 1993 Mercury RecordsReleased on.
