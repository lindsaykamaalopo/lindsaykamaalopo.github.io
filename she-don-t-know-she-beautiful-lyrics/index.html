<p>I can go a little while longer she fades away She dont see her perfect She dont understand shes worth it Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface Ah oh ah ah oh So to all the girls thats hurting Let me be your mirror Help you see a little bit clearer The light that shines within Theres a hope thats waiting for you in the dark You should know youre beautiful just the way you are And you dont have to change a thing. She dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind She dont know shes beautiful no shes not that kind She dont know shes beautiful Though time and time Ive told her so There she goes just walking down the street And someone lets a whistle out A girl like her she just cant see What the fuss is all about And she dont know shes beautiful never crossed her mind.
